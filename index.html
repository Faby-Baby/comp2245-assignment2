                <p>Free medical care is beneficial for citizens of any country. Sweden is one country that has implemented a Universal Healthcare program. 
                    Healthcare in Sweden is funded by taxing the citizens. 
                    Although this results in higher taxes, its citizens can access medical care for any illnesses from which they suffer free of charge. 
                    Citizens may also purchase health insurance plans from private companies to supplement their free healthcare. 
                    This results in a higher life expectancy, healthier citizens overall, positive net population growth, and better economic stability for its citizens. The United States of America on the other hand does not employ Universal Healthcare.
                    Medical care in America is very expensive. The cost of these health services usually leaves citizens in crippling debt or death because they cannot afford the necessary medication to stay alive. </p>

                <p>Citizens may purchase health insurance plans from insurance companies, but these plans do not cover the full cost of medical bills. 
                    Citizens still must spend thousands of dollars to pay for their medical care. Comparing the USA to Sweden, one can see that Sweden has a higher life expectancy, happier and healthier citizens, and a better way of life for its citizens. 
                    Free health care vastly improves the way of life for citizens in many aspects.</p>

                <h2>Family</h2>

                <p> Family is not confined to blood relations. An adoptee would consider their adopter their family since they raised, loved, and provided for them. 
                    On the other hand, even though their biological parents are related to them by blood, they might not consider them to be family because they received no support or guidance from them. 
                    The joining of two people in marriage is a creation of a new family whose members are not blood relations. </p>

                <p>Through their marital vows, they pledge to love and support each other through good and bad times. 
                    A family is bound not only by blood, but by their strong emotional ties with each other. 
                    In fact, some people might not consider their blood relatives family due to abuse or neglect. 
                    If a group of non-blood related individuals considered one another family, then they are family.</p>
